# Advanced Input

## Advanced Input

The advanced input feature allows for a quicker and more efficient method of submitting trades. When using general elements on the New Trade interface, you can see what the advanced format version of your trade would be. The advanced method uses abbreviations and keywords that describe your trade data.\
It starts with a trigger that specifies if the submissions is opening or closing a trade, and the direction of it. A ticker symbol if always followed after the trigger, and if options then the expiration date, strike price, and call/put. For crypto trades the pair is included with with the ticker while using a `/` as the separator. It the ends with `@ <price>` where \<price> is replaced with your submitted price. See below for more info and examples.

If you're experienced or familiar with using the NVST.ly Discord bot, the advanced input method is exactly the same as submitting trades via text commands.
