# Moomoo Integration

## Linking Moomoo

Steps to link Moomoo are already displayed on the app in [Brokers & Exchanges](https://nvstly.com/settings/brokers) settings.

Instruction steps will also be added on this page, including a how-to video.





## Auto Login & Startup on Boot

For a completely hands-free convienent experience, follow the steps below for [Windows](moomoo-integration.md#windows) or [macOS](moomoo-integration.md#macos) to have the OpenD client launch & automatically login when your PC starts up.

### Windows

1. First, on the OpenD login screen, make sure to check "Remember Me" and "Auto Login" boxes.
2.  In the _Start Menu_ or _Search_ field on the bottom taskbar, type in "OpenD" to find Moomoo OpenD. Right click on it and click _Open File Location_. This should take you to `C:\ProgramData\Microsoft\Windows\Start Menu\Programs`, copy the Moomoo OpenD shortcut that it brought you to.\

3. **Press** `Win + R` and type `shell:startup`, then press **Enter**.
   *   This opens the **Startup** folder where programs automatically launch when your PC starts & you login. (I.e. `C:\Users\Username\AppData\Roaming\Microsoft\Windows\Start Menu\Programs\Startup`)\

4. Paste the Moomoo OpenD shortcut into this folder.
5. That's it. Now every time you turn on your PC, OpenD will start and you'll automatically login. _(Make sure to check the Remember Me and Auto Login boxes on OpenD signin screen.)_
