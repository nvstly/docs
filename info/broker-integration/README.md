# Broker Integration

Brokerage integration provides faster trade submissions through automation. When a broker is connected or linked to NVSTly, all executed trades are automatically submitted to the app. This provides hands-free trade submissions in real-time, as well automating a trader's signals or Trade Sharing.

{% hint style="warning" %}
Linking or connecting a broker only shares trades with the app, it **cannot** create or execute orders.
{% endhint %}
