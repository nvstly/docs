# Sign Up & Login

### Issue signing up with Apple?

Using email forwarding or the "Hide My Email" feature when signing up with Apple will give you the following error.

{% hint style="warning" %}
Apple email forwarding is not supported. Please revoke access in Apple ID settings and retry and select 'Share My Email'.
{% endhint %}

To fix this, the NVST.ly app needs to be unlinked from your Apple account, then signing up again without using Apple's "Hide My Email" feature.

1. Head to your [Apple ID settings](https://appleid.apple.com/account/manage/section/security).
2. Go to Sign-in and Security settings.
3. Click the Sign in with Apple box.\

8. When signing up with Apple, be sure to enable "Share My Email" and hit Continue.\
