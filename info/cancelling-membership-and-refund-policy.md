# Cancelling Membership & Refund Policy

## How to Cancel Membership Subscriptions

### Cancelling Your Membership

Cancelling your NVSTly membership is simple and can be done directly from your account settings:

1. Go to **Account Settings >** [**Membership**](https://nvstly.com/settings/membership).
2. On the bottom left, below the membership plans, click the **Manage Membership** button.
3. You will be redirected to **Stripe's Dashboard** (our payment processor), where you can cancel your subscription. _(Or update billing methods)_

Once cancelled, your membership will remain active until the end of your current billing cycle. You will not be charged for the following cycle, and your subscription will terminate automatically at that time.

### **No-Refund Policy**

NVSTly has a **strict no-refund policy**. You are responsible for managing your subscription and cancelling before the next billing cycle to avoid unwanted charges.

**Exceptions:** If you accidentally renew your subscription and contact us within **48â€“72 hours** of your latest billing, we may issue a full refund upon cancellation of the subscription.

It is your responsibility to track your billing cycle and cancel in time if you no longer wish to remain subscribed to our membership plans.
