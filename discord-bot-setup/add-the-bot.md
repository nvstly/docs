## Permissions

The bot's permissions are required for it to function, this is to ensure a high quality user experience as it was intended. None of these permissions are security sensitive.

\
There is 1 **optional** permission that you can grant the bot after it has been added. The `Manage Roles` permission will allow the bot to create roles that are linked to badges on the website such as _**Top Trader**_ and _**High Win Rate**_ which are rewarded to traders who earned them from holding a top ranked position on the leaderboard, or having a 70% win rate or higher.

### Greeting Message

When the bot joins the server it scans for channels with the keywords "general", "hangout", & "chat" to send it's greeting message. If it does not detect a channel containing a key word it sends the message into the first channel it has the `Send Messages` permission. \
\
This greeting message will inform you that a setup is not required but will prompt you with the available commands for settings.\
