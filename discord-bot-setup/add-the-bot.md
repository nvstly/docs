# Add the Bot

## Inviting the bot

To add the bot to your server you will need to invite it using the [invite link](https://trhub.net/addbot) then select the server you want to add it to. [https://trhub.net/addbot](https://trhub.net/addbot)\

## Permissions

The bot's permissions are required for it to function, this is to ensure a quality user experience as it was intended. None of these permissions are harmful or abusable so you can be free of any worry.![](<../.gitbook/assets/image (117).png>)\
\
There is 1 **optional** permission that you can grant the bot after it has been added. The _Manage Roles_ permission will allow the bot to create roles that are linked to badges on the website such as _**Top Trader**_ and _**High Win Rate**_ which are rewarded to traders who have earned them from holding a top ranked position on the leaderboard, or have a 70% win rate or higher.

### Greeting Message

When the bot joins the server it scans for channels with the keywords "general", "hangout", & "chat" to send it's greeting message. If it does not detect a channel containing a key word it sends the message into the first channel it has the _Send Messages_ permission. \
\
This greeting message will inform you a setup is not required but will prompt you with the available commands for settings.\
