# Server Settings



{% hint style="warning" %}
All text based commands can also be used via /slash commands.
{% endhint %}

**The bot can be added with the required permissions and used in any channel immediately without any setup needed.** For a list of all available settings, use the `/setup` or `$setup` command.

## Prefix

{% hint style="info" %}
**$prefix \<new-prefix>**\
I.e `$prefix !`
{% endhint %}

The bot's prefix can be changed to any character, the prefix is used to trigger bot commands- everything except submitting trades.
