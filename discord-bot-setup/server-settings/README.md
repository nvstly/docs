# Server Settings

**The bot can be added with the required permissions and used in any channel immediately without any setup needed.** Servers are not one size fits all so there are some settings that can be tailored to fit your server.



## Prefix

{% hint style="info" %}
**$prefix \<new-prefix>**\
I.e `$prefix !`
{% endhint %}
