# Overview

{% hint style="danger" %}
When submitting a crypto trade, you need to use a separator between the coin and the trading pair. Available separators are: `/` `-` `_` `&` or `.`
{% endhint %}

### Important

Crypto trade tracking is generally the same as stocks/options, but has more sophisticated additional features to provide better timely trade submissions. Be sure to check out the [defaults.md](defaults.md "mention")section to learn all about these features and how to submit crypto trades most efficiently.&#x20;

### Prices

The bot checks against real-time market prices when trades are submitted. To allow for volatility and time it takes to submit, the submitted price can be off by a small threshold based on our price tolerance system. This is to prevent traders manipulating stats and cheating ranks.

This video will guide you through on how to properly use the Discord bot for submitting (stock only) trades. This is an old version 1 video, and a lot has been added & changed since then but is still helpful for covering the basics and seeing it in action. All features and functionalities can be found in the articles below.

This video was recorded during week 2 BETA (v0.2). Although it doesn't cover everything, it's a great short video to see how the bot works and the basics of submitting your trades.
