# Opening Short Position

### Crypto Input

{% hint style="info" %}
**STO \<ticker/pair> @ \<price>**\
I.e. _`BTO BTC/USDT @ 19,000`_
{% endhint %}

To open your **short** crypto position, use the trigger **`STO`** followed by the _ticker/pair_ and use `@` before your price. \

If your default trading market is set to `crypto`, you don't need to specify the pair- unless you are trading a different pair than your default.\

If you are submitting a trade from a different exchange than your default, specify the exchange name after the price. _It can be mentioned anywhere within your notes._\
