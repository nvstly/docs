# Average Up/Down

There is no extra trigger or syntax to average your trades. If you have an open crypto trade and submit the same trade again with an opening trigger, it will calculate your new average.\
\
For example, if you input `BTO BTC/USDT @ 19,000` and do not close it, when you put in another entry such as `BTO BTC/USDT @ 18,750,` it will already know you have an existing open trade for this ticker and will auto calculate the new average for this trade to $18,875.\
