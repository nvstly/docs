# Trim/Partial Close

{% hint style="success" %}
Trim/Partial Keywords\
`TRIM` - `SCAL` - `PART` - `Leaving Some` are all keywords to trigger a trim/partial close & can be used anywhere within the notes.\
_(trimming, scale, scaling, partial, partially)_
{% endhint %}

> I.e. _`STC BTC/USDT @ 25000 trim`_

To trim or partially close trades and keep them open, use the trim/partial keywords at the end of the trade or anywhere within the notes, such as `trim` `trimming` `scale` `scaling` `partial` `partially`.&#x20;

{% endtab %}

{% tab title="Example #2" %}
![](<../.gitbook/assets/image (1) (1) (1) (1) (1) (1) (1) (1).png>)Example of partially closing DOT/USDT position
{% endtab %}

{% tab title="Example #3" %}
![](<../.gitbook/assets/image (2) (1) (1) (1) (1) (1) (1).png>)Example of partially closing ADA/USDT position
{% endtab %}
{% endtabs %}

When closing trades with trim/partial exit, the final gain percentage is generated by calculating the trim(s) and exit returns which is used for final gain/loss that is factored into stats.

### Using Slash Commands

The same concept applies to slash commands as with text commands. When using the `/close` command, use any of the trim/partial keywords (trim, trimming, partial, etc.) anywhere in the notes field to trim/partially close a position.

{% hint style="warning" %}
Trades that have been trimmed/partially closed will calculate the final gain percentage differently. The returns of each trim/partial and the closing return will be calculated into an average gain/return which is used toward stats. However, the bot will reply with an Entry to Exit gain/loss percentage for trades that have been trimmed/partially closed, but this value does not factor into stats and is only for cosmetic purposes.
