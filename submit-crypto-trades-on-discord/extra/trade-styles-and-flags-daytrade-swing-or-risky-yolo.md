  Trades can be marked by the style they are (swing, scalp, etc.) and flagged
  with risk factors (risky, yolo) which will assign an icon highlighting the
  risk.

# Trade Styles & Flags (daytrade/swing or risky/yolo)

## Styles

{% hint style="info" %}
Available trade styles:\
Daytrade - Swing - Scalp - Long Term
{% endhint %}

Marking your trades style doesn't have any effect on the trade, it's just labeling the type of trade it is.\
![](<../../.gitbook/assets/image (77).png>)\
\
By default all trades are labeled as `Daytrade`. Using `Swing` or `Scalp` anywhere in your notes will label your trade as such as shown in the example above.\

{% hint style="warning" %}
Trade styles & flags can be used anywhere in the notes to label them as such.
{% endhint %}

## Flags

{% hint style="danger" %}
YOLO trades are exempted from stats. _In a future version they will have their own stats in the stats expansion on dashboards._
{% endhint %}

{% hint style="info" %}
`yolo` will be marked as _High Risk YOLO Play_ \
\
`risk` or `risky` or `high risk` will be marked as _High Risk Play_
{% endhint %}

Using any of these keywords in your trade's notes will mark your trade with it's associated flag, placing an icon on the app display for that trade.\
\
These trades displayed on the app will have an icon associating with the relevant risk, and when hovered will give detail on that type of risk.
