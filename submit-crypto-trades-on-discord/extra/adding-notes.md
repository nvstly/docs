Notes are there for yourself or to show other traders any comments you might have about the trade- it can be analysis, what made you enter/exit a position such as an earnings report, or anything you wish to add.\
\
Notes are displayed on the website in several places. The [Trades](https://thetradehub.net/trades) page, a Trade Insight page, and on [Dashboards](https://thetradehub.net/trades) but can be cut off. Full notes will be shown on the dropdown section of the Trades page, and on Trade Insight pages.\
