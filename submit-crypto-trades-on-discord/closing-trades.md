# Closing Trades

{% hint style="info" %}
Closing triggers;\
**`STC`** is used to close long\
**`BTC`** is used to close short
{% endhint %}

### Closing Long

> **STC \<ticker>/\<pair> @ \<price> \[exchange]**\
> I.e. _`STC BTC/USDT @ 26995 binance`_

To close a **long** crypto position, use the trigger **`STC`** followed by the ticker/pair (I.e. BTC/USDT), then the symbol @ before the price. By default on new accounts, the crypto exchange is set to Binance and if an exchange name is not specified the bot will log the trade for the Binance exchange. \
The default exchange, among other (market, pair) defaults, can be changed. See [defaults.md](defaults.md "mention")for more info.

### Closing Short

To close a **short** crypto position, use the trigger **`STC`** followed by the ticker/pair (I.e. BTC/USDT), then the symbol @ before the price. By default on new accounts, the crypto exchange is set to Binance and if an exchange name is not specified the bot will log the trade for the Binance exchange. \
The default exchange, among other (market, pair) defaults, can be changed. See [defaults.md](defaults.md "mention")for more info.

{% hint style="warning" %}
Final Notes:\
\- **Do not use `$` with tickers.** \
\- Submit using a specified price, or use `CMP` or `M` for submitting at the current market price.\
\- Multiple trades can be submitted in a single message by using 3 back ticks (\`\`\`) before and after the whole message.
{% endhint %}



## Using Slash Commands

Submitting trades through slash commands has a more user friendly aspect to it but can take some seconds longer than text messages.

Type in `/close` then select `crypto`.

Type in or select the direction `Long` or `Short`.&#x20;

Type in or select an exchange.

Input the ticker & pair with a separator. (I.e. BTC/USDT)

Enter in the price or use `0` for the current market price.

Notes can be added and are optional. Trimming or partially closing positions can be done by using the [Trim/Partial Close](trim-partial-close.md) keywords (trim, trimming, partial, etc.) within the notes.
