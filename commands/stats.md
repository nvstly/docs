# Stats



{% hint style="info" %}
**$stats \[@user/username] \[-t time]**\
User & time optional\
I.e. _`$stats`_ | _`$stats @Hubert`_ | _`$stats @Hubert -t 2w`_ | _`$stats Trader One`_
{% endhint %}

You can check your stats or another trader's by using the `$stats` command followed by their username. By default, it will display their career or all-time stats. Using the `-time` or `-t` syntax will allow you to select a time frame to show stats for.\
\
You can show stats for days, weeks, months, and years using `d` `w` `mo` `y` after the number of time frame length. `$stats` @Hubert `-t 2w` will show the last two weeks of stats for the trader Hubert.\
