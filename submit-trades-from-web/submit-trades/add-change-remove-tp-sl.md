# Add, Change, Remove TP/SL

When [submitting a trade](./), after inputting the direction, ticker, and price, there is a 2nd _(optional)_ prompt to add notes or set values for TP and SL. The only other method of adding, updating, or removing these values is on the [Trade Insight](../../info/user-interfaces-overview.md#trade-insight) interface. On the top section there are edit icons under TP and SL. Clicking these edit icons will prompt you to enter their values. You can edit these values as at any time while the position is open. To remove these values click the edit icon, don't enter any value, and hit submit- your previous value will be removed.
