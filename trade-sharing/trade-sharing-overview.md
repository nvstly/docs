# Trade Sharing Overview

The ability to share your trades and flex your stats is one of the more popular appealing features. We've aimed to deliver this functionality to fit the needs of various traders seeking this capability. Whether you're a guru spreading your wisdom and signals on social media or Discord, or looking for that credibility on the banger you mentioned last month, or just to share with your followers what you're buying and selling. You can share your trades to Discord via webhooks automatically with the option to customize the message or embed content. Currently, trades can be tweeted upon submitting them, and will have automatic tweets for sharing trades in the near future.

By default, we have pre-set message content for sharing to Discord and Twitter, but you can change 100% of their appearance and deck them out however you'd like!

## How It Works

Sharing to Discord instantly occurs via your webhooks after submitting a trade. The message or embed that is sent to the webhook(s) can be fully customized with many features and market data to help.\
\
With Twitter, as soon as you submit a trade a new browser window will open up with a pre-filled out tweet for you to send. This default tweet content can also be fully customized. We plan to work with Twitter's API to provide automatic tweets for trade sharing in the near future.

There is no setup required for Twitter, but you can still customize how your preset tweets will look by building your own, see [customize-messages-or-embeds.md](customize-messages-or-embeds.md "mention")
