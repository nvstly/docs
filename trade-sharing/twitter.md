# Twitter

Trades can also be sent to Twitter. Currently you will need to confirm each tweet after submitting a trade position, but we'll be implementing the option to fully automate it which will require the user to create a Twitter developer account and prvoide their API keys so our app can post tweets on your behalf.\
\
To share your trades to Twitter you can either enable it in your [account settings](https://thetradehub.net/settings), or just check the _Share to Twitter_ box when submitting a trade through the [New Trade](https://thetradehub.net/submit) feature.\

{% hint style="info" %}
_When enabled in settings, will always be enabled in New Trade_
{% endhint %}

You have full permissions of how your message or embed looks when sent. We've built a 'no-code' message builder for your Discord trade sharing, scope it out in your [account settings](https://thetradehub.net/settings). There is where you'll also specify the webhooks you wish Trade Hub to use for sending out your trades.

**You can customize each trade event message:**

* Open
* Average
* Trim/Partial
* Closing

**With every data property of the trade, and more:**

* Direction (long/short)
* Ticker (and ticker logo)
* Expiration date
* Strike Price
* Call/put
* Notes
* Link to Trade Insight page
* Styles & flags
* Curent market price of ticker
* Daily high/low price of ticker
* [And so much more](https://docs.thetradehub.net/trade-sharing/customize-messages-or-embeds)

### To learn how to customize your trade's message content, see the [customize-messages-or-embeds.md](customize-messages-or-embeds.md "mention") section.
