# Exclusive & Private Ticker Bots

## Exclusive Bots

Exclusive bots are available to a limited number of servers, guaranteeing 99% uptime and updating prices within 10 seconds. If an exclusive bot reaches its server limit and experiences slower updates, we create additional exclusive bots for those tickers to maintain our 100% quick price updates during uptime guarantee. Exclusive bots are also perfect for tickers without free public bot support, with no limit on the number of ticker bots that can be created.

The bot's profile aesthetics mirror those of the public bots, featuring the same nickname format (`<TICKER> ⬈/⬊ <price>`), status formats, avatar, profile banner, and bio.

## Private Bots

Private bots are exclusive to the servers they are customized for. Servers have the option to either create their own bot or have us create one for them. These private bots come with a personalized avatar, banner, and bio description, along with customized nickname and custom status formats. They are tailored specifically to each server's preferences and can incorporate their own branding.

### Free Public Bots & Limitations

We currently manage approximately 100 public free ticker bots, with some bots present in over 2,500 servers. As the number of servers increases, these bots require more RAM resources. This necessitates accommodations such as migrating them to new server hosts or increasing the RAM on their existing host.

Additionally, Discord's API rate limitations affect bots in more servers, causing them to update their prices less frequently. Due to the way we display prices in their nicknames and the constraints of Discord's API, bots must update their nickname in each individual server. Consequently, bots in hundreds or thousands of servers require more time to update their nicknames to avoid API rate limits, which could result in temporary timeouts for all the bots.

### Exclusive & Private Bots with 99% Online Uptime

Exclusive bots are limited to servers that have purchased them. If they reach a threshold where they cannot update prices within 10 seconds, we create additional bots for those tickers. These bots receive top resource priority, and we are committed to maintaining their operation even if public bots experience temporary downtime. We guarantee 99% online uptime with 100% price updates during their uptime.
