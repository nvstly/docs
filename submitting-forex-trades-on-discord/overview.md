  Trade Hub dashboard and calculated towards stats. Very similar to both stocks

# Overview

This section is still in the works and will go over in-depth how to submit forex trades.\
\
For now, you can follow the [Broken link](broken-reference "mention")section, and when using forex tickers don't use a `/` separator. \
\
Examples:\
BTO USDCAD @ \<price>\
STC USDCAD @ \<price>\
\
**Wrong:**\
BTO USD/CAD @ \<price>\
\
\
For now it doesn't work in the way with PIPs, only gain/loss percentage of entry price & exit price.
