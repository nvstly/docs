# Overview

### Important

Forex trade tracking is generally the same as stocks, or crypto but not as sophisticated. When tracking or submitting forex trades, no separator like a `/` slash or any character should be used between the base and quote currency tickers.

### Prices

The bot checks against real-time market prices when trades are submitted. To allow for volatility and time it takes to submit, the submitted price can be off by a small threshold based on our price tolerance system. This is to prevent traders manipulating stats and cheating ranks.

This video will guide you through on how to properly use the Discord bot for submitting (stock only) trades. This is an old version 1 video, and a lot has been added & changed since then but is still helpful for covering the basics and seeing it in action. All features and functionalities can be found in the articles below.
