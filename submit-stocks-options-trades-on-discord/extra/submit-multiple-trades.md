# Submit Multiple Trades

{% hint style="info" %}
\`\`\`\
`<trade input>`\
`<trade input>`\
\`\`\`
{% endhint %}

You can open multiple positions at once in a single message by placing the inputs in a code block using three (3) backticks before and after the inputs. You can open/close however many trades you'd like, but we suggest keeping it under 10 to avoid any being missed.

#### Example

![](<../../.gitbook/assets/image (68).png>)![](<../../.gitbook/assets/image (92).png>)
