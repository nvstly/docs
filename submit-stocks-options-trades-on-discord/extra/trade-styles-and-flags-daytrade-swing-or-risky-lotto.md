# Trade Styles & Flags (daytrade/swing or risky/lotto)

## Styles

{% hint style="info" %}
Available trade styles:\
Daytrade - Swing - Scalp - Long Term
{% endhint %}

Marking your trading style doesn't have any effect on the trade, it's just labeling the type of trade it is.\
![](<../../.gitbook/assets/image (125).png>)\
\
By default, all trades are labeled as `Daytrade`. Using `Swing` or `Scalp` anywhere in your notes will label your trade as such, as shown in the example above.\

![Style keywords can be used as verbs](<../../.gitbook/assets/image (19).png>)

{% hint style="warning" %}
Trade styles & flags can be used anywhere in the notes
{% endhint %}

## Flags

{% hint style="danger" %}
Lotto & YOLO trades are exempted from stats. _In a future version they will have their own stats in the stats expansion on dashboards._
{% endhint %}

{% hint style="info" %}
`lotto` or `yolo` will be marked as _High Risk YOLO Play_\
\
`risk` or `risky` or `high risk` will be marked as _High Risk Play_\
\
`earnings` or `er` will be marked as _Earnings Play_
{% endhint %}

Using any of these keywords in your trade's notes will mark your trade with its associated flag, placing an icon on the app display for that trade. \
\
These trades displayed on the app will have an icon associated with the relevant risk, and when hovered over will give detail on that type of risk.
