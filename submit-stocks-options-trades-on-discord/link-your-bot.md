  behalf to be tracked and shared.

# Link Your Bot

{% hint style="info" %}
$linkbot \<bot-id-here>\
I.e. `$linkbot 901245095502819358` or $lb 901245095502819358
{% endhint %}

If you send signals or trade alerts through your own Discord bot, you can link it to your Trade Hub account where our trade tracking bot can accept trades from it.\
\
Currently, only regular text messages are supported- no embeds, yet. Our bot still recognizes the same format for submitting trades in Discord, so if your personal bot doesn't use the correct format, it will not work.
