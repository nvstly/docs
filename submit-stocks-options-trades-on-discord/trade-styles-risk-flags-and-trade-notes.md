# Trade Styles, Risk Flags, & Trade Notes

Trade Styles

Available trade styles:\
Daytrade - Swing - Scalp - Long Term

Specifying the style of a trade has no functionality other than cosmetic and informational purposes. It can help viewers whether the trade is short or long term. By default, all trades use the `Daytrade` style unless specified otherwise.&#x20;

To set the style of a trade, mention any one of the style keywords anywhere in the trade notes.
