# Trim/Partial Close

{% hint style="info" %}
**TRIM** - **SCAL** - **PART** are all keywords to trigger trim/partial close. \
_(trimming, scale, scaling, partial, partially)_
{% endhint %}

{% hint style="success" %}
I.e. _**`STC AAPL @ 150 partial`**_\
_**`BTC SPY 4/01 460p @ 2.40 trim`**_
{% endhint %}

To trim or partially close trades and keep them open, use the triggering keywords at the end of the trade, such as `trim` `trimming` `scale` `scaling` `partial` `partially`. \
\
When closing trades with trim/partial exit, the final gain percentage is generated by calculating the trim(s) and exit which is used for your final gain/loss.\

These aliases can now be used anywhere in the notes to trim or partially close trades.
