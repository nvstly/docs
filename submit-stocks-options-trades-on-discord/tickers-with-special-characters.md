Stocks with more than one class of shares that contain a dot in their ticker symbol need to be submitted without the dot.&#x20;

The symbols in the left column are those the bot recognizes. When submitting a trade containing any of these symbols, simply just remove the dot or dash and the bot will recognize it.

## Index Ticker Symbols

Some indices have options that can be traded, and typically use an up arrow in their ticker symbol- or sometimes are known as completely different than their actual ticker. For example, the S\&P 500 is commonlly referred to as SPX, but the actual ticker is ^GSPC.
